> - Primary Attributions: Who are the initial/main authors of the content? These are the people who are most responsible for having developed the content of the item.
> - Secondary Attributions: Who are the secondary authors of the content? These are the people who have made contributions to the content of the item, whether in terms of identifying corrections, suggested improvements, or implmenting some minor changes to the content.
> - Editors: Who (if anyone) was responsible for performing the final editing of the content (other than the primary authors)?
