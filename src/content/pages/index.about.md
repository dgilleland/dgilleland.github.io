I've been teaching **_computer programming_** at the post-secondary level since 2000. Before that, I've had an assortment of low-level jobs in all sorts of areas. My decision to get back into programming came around the early to mid 1990s. My prior experience in computers goes back to high school in the late '70s, early 80's.

I am a Christian. If you're not sure what that means, it means that I believe that the **Jesus** of the Bible actually rose from the dead as a historical event, and that He is God the Son, our Creator and Redeemer. Some of you reading this might think, *"That's ludicrous!"*. But I challenge you to honestly and openly examine the evidence, because there's a ***lot* of evidence**. 

**Back to programming:** I focus mostly in the Microsoft (*C#*, *T-SQL*, etc.) and Web (*HTML*, *JavaScript*, *TypeScript*, etc.) tech stacks. I've dabbled enough in other areas to feel conversant *and* to know where I like to keep my skills current. I enjoy learning and helping others to learn. In the process, I both build and break things. I love to research and I'm continually learning. As such, I swing between bouts of euphoric enlightenment &mdash; *"I'm a genius!"* &mdash; and abashed embarassment &mdash; *"I know nothing!"*

I like to think that I'm still a work in progress.

This site is a redesign taking place in the spring of 2024. Hopefully I'll be able to regather my notes and resources from their current locations scattered about the web and my computer. I figure I might as well make it easier for people to find and search.
