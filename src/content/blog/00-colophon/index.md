This site is build on [Astro](https://astro.build) and is originally based on the [Astro-Sphere theme](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere) by [*Mark Horn*](https://github.com/markhorn-dev).

It's actually been quite a while since I last rebuilt this, my "Instructor's Website. The previous incarnation (6 years ago) was based on *VuePress* (which, incidentally, just went to a 1.0 status!). It seemed my best choice at the time, and before that I think it was done in Angular 1.x.
