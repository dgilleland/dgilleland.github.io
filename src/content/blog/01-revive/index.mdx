# What's Going On?

After yet another long hiatus, my instructor website is undergoing a reconstruction.

I've actually been working on my instructor website since the early 2000s. I knew that having some kind of site that I can point students to for resources and information would be useful. But key to making it all work in the ways I wanted was to have it easy to maintain in both content and design. Not an easy task, given the state of web technologies at the time.

Fast-forward to today, and I'm rebuilding from the ground up on Astro. My last build was on VuePress, for which I was holding great promise. Of course, that was before the whole COVID thing which sidetracked a lot of my plans.

So, what has changed? First of all, I started with an Astro template/theme by Mark Horn called *Astro Sphrere*. It was pretty clean and easy to understand and modify. I liked the aspect that it made use of Tailwind (which I am only now starting to explore). After a few modifications where I could make some clean separations between content and style, I think I've got something that I can work well with. What's even better is the whole aspect that I get to focus on Markdown for my content and that it's extensible via MDX and any combination of JS frameworks. Components and Islands for the win!

There's a lot to be done with this. I'll be adopting it to my personal blog/site as well, and between the two I want to consolidate the various articles and tutorials that I've written over the years. Given that the diploma for which I teach is being replaced with a new one, these will become an effective archive for my old material and a home for what's new.
