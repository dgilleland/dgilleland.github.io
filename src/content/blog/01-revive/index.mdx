After yet another long hiatus, my instructor website is undergoing a reconstruction.

I've actually been working on my instructor website since the early 2000s. I knew that having some kind of site that I can point students to for resources and information would be useful. But key to making it all work in the ways I wanted was to have it easy to maintain in both content and design. Not an easy task, given the state of web technologies at the time.

Fast-forward to today, and I'm rebuilding from the ground up on Astro. My last build was on VuePress, for which I was holding great promise. Of course, that was before the whole COVID thing which sidetracked a lot of my plans.
