I'm moving towards GitHub for my blogging, and it made sense for me to do that in my role as an Instructor at NAIT. So, this is my "_Hello World_" post, after getting things set up using [Barry Clark's Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "Try it out for yourself! It's a nice, quick way to get going with GitHub and Blogging.") template (and discarding my earlier attempts to "roll-my-own"). This particular page I've edited using [Prose.io](http://prose.io/), and it looks like a nice, clean editor. I'll have to see how I like it, going forward.

Not-so-needless to say (and shown below :point_down:), the information posted here is my own (unless someone has hacked my account) and does not represent the opinions and views of my employer, co-workers, etc etc.

So, the next big thing for me to do is migrate my old content from a CMS site into this one as static content. It might take a while, so be patient with me....
